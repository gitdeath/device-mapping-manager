I've forked to take advantage of the startup PR that wasn't merged from the original (https://github.com/allfro/device-mapping-manager.)


# device-mapping-manager

This maps and enables devices into containers running on docker swarm. It is currently only compatible with linux systems that use cgroup v1 and v2.
